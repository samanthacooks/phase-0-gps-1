# Samantha Cooks Reflection on GPS 1.1

**Monday February 20, 9pm EST**



* Prior to the GPS session, a Git concept I was struggling with understanding was creating push and pull requests to GitHub. Going through the process with my pair gave me a clearer idea of the order of tasks. 

* During the GPS session quite a few concepts were clarified for me; including push and pull requests, fetch, and merge. Working through the processes with my pair, while hearing his interpretation of how the commands are defined gave me a different perspective of understanding.

* During the session, I asked my pair and guide how they defined the wording of a commit message. I'd read on one of my resources that a commit message should start with a command (Add, Update, Remove). They both agreed that as long as the commit message is descriptive and direct, the actual wording doesn't matter. I also asked my guide about the dynamics between the driver and navigator, questioning how vocal should the driver be. He gave me great feedback on this and I feel much more comfortable for my next peering session.

* I still have confusion on the roles of fetch and merge in Git. I also need to keep practicing the process of pulling and pushing data locally from the repository. My guide recommended a tutorial on Git that I am going to review before moving forward with challenges this week.

* My first experience using GPS was a good one. I was nervous initially about the session because I did not know how my pair's learning style would mesh with mine. It ended up feeling like an open, collaborative environment so my worries were laid to rest early in the session.
